0.037     2017-10-27 17:27:41-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed test that depended on YAML.pm (which we removed as
      a dependency). Now the test uses YAML::Tiny instead. Thanks
      @ltriant! (Github #155)

0.036     2017-10-25 23:32:12-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Removed]

    - Removed the `ymask` command and associated prereqs. This command
      just wasn't very useful, and depended on a module that requires
      a compiler.

    [Added]

    - Added `parse_time` function to `yq`. This function parses
      a date/time string into a UNIX epoch.

    - Added epoch timestamps as an allowed format for `yts` time series
      timestamps.

    - Add default timestamps of "now" in `yts`. This makes all time
      series databases the same and makes it easier to add metrics.

    - Added 'LINUX.PROC.LOADAVG' and 'LINUX.PROC.UPTIME' patterns to
      `ygrok` to parse the `/proc/loadavg` and `/proc/uptime` files on
      Linux systems.

    [Fixed]

    - Reduced version requirement for List::Util. This continues our
      quest to be installable on a core Perl 5.10 without a compiler.

    - Removed unused prereq (Text::Trim).

0.035     2017-10-18 20:52:11-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Removed 'Z' time zone indicator from yts input/output and time
      series adapters. Time zone does not enter in to any of the things
      we're doing with time series. If users need to do things with time
      zones, they'll have to do it themselves (poor souls).

0.034     2017-10-12 19:45:03-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed a race condition that could cause `yts` to read the data and
      not write the data passed-in on `STDIN`. This requires a new
      dependency, IO::Interactive.

    - Removed dependencies on some modules to reduce the memory
      footprint and improve startup times:

      * DateTime
      * Moo
      * Type::Tiny

    - Removed some unused modules that are not going to be developed
      anymore.

      * Parse::RecDescent versions of the `yq` language parser. Perl
        5.10 regex grammars work just fine.

    - Fixed YAML.pm (YAML::Old) causing tests to fail. This has been
      removed (for now) as a supported YAML module. The default
      supported YAML module is now YAML::Tiny.

0.033     2017-10-12 01:18:55-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added Graphite time series adapter. Now `yts` can read/write time
      series from the Graphite system and related subsystems. The write
      function is compatible with the "line" protocol, so any databases
      that understand Graphite's line protocol can be written to.
    - Added --start and --end options to yts command to constrain the
      time series returned to a specific date/time range.

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed the `yts` time series format. Now there is only the "metric"
      to identify the time series, which for some time series databases
      may contain abstractions like "database" and "column".
    - Fixed nulls appearing in Graphite time series.

0.032     2017-08-25 21:42:30-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed a problem where `ysql` would refuse to work as the first
      part of a cron job, thus making it useless for gathering metrics
      to be written to `yts`. Now we also check to see if `STDIN` is
      attached to something with some size...

0.031     2017-08-25 18:04:03-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - ysql now has a `--count` helper to count the number of entries in
      a table (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <table>`). This also works with the
      `--where` helper to limit the rows counted. This is going to be
      especially useful with the new `yts` time series command.

    - The `yts` command to work with time series databases like
      InfluxDB, Graphite (Carbon), RRDTool, Prometheus, and the like.
      Only InfluxDB is available so far. If you want to contribute an
      adapter for the others, let me know!

0.030     2017-08-24 13:25:23-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Removed out-of-date Build.PL that was no longer being generated.
      This caused some CPAN clients to fail to install the right
      prerequisites. Thanks @andk and CPAN Testers!

0.029     2017-08-16 23:11:30-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - We now give better error messages when accidentally trying to
      insert hashrefs or arrayrefs into a column using the `ysql`
      `--insert` helper. SQL::Abstract does not allow this and instead
      gives an untrappable warning (instead of throwing an exception,
      which is potentially earmarked for SQL::Abstract v2)

    [Added]

    - yq's filter language now allows `$.` to refer to the initial
      document even if the current document (`.`) is something else.
      This way one can traverse the document using `|` filters and still
      get to the original.

    - yq's filter language now allows assigning values to filters, so
      you can modify documents in-place.

    - yq's filter language now has an `each()` function to iterate over
      hashes/arrays

    - yq's filter language now allows function calls on either side of
      binary operators (assignment operator and comparison operators).
      This means we can filter based on the output of a function (like
      find all arrays with more than 5 elements) or assign the output of
      a function to a place in the document (like replace an array with
      its length).

0.028     2016-10-09 23:08:36-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - The YAML::Tiny module is now officially supported
    - The YERTL_FORMAT environment variable will set the default format
      that Yertl uses to communicate. Set it to `json` for Yertl to
      seamlessly interoperate with other JSON-based tools like `jq` and
      `recs`.
    - CSV conversion (`yto`/`yfrom`) now allows setting a delimiter so
      we can parse colon-separated values or esoteric formats

    [Fixed]

    - `yq -x` now checks for definedness before trying to print. This
      silences warnings from Perl about "Uninitialized value in print".
      In the future, we may re-enable warnings through a `-w` or `-v`
      switch.
    - If one filter in a pipe returns empty, that empty result is
      propagated through further filters. This makes the output of
      something like `select( .foo == 1 ) | .bar` more intuitive: If
      a document doesn't pass the first part, the result of the second
      part is `empty`, not `undef` (`--- ~`).
    - The `ysql` helpers and placeholders are now better documented in
      the ysql guide.

    [Other]

    - ygrok tests are now split into more maintainable chunks based on
      the patterns they are testing.
